<h1>Signal-to-Noise:</h1>

<p>Good: CNN.com give good relevant information on what is going on that day and the week.  The website stays on relevant information for the most part.  Nowhere near as bad as Facebook.</p>

<p>Bad: Facebook is bad with signal to noise.  Facebook gives good information and it also gives pointless information.  Some information isnt relevant at all.</p>


<h2>Affordance:</h2>

<p>Good:  Amazon.com when you push add to cart the product adds to your cart.  The button is very clear and makes you want to push the button to add the product to cart.  You also get feed back from the site that you added the product to the cart.</p>

<p>Bad: Jets pizza website is a very poor affordance site.  You cant click on any of the images to get the pizza showing or the wings.  The only button that really works is order now on the home screen.</p>

<h3>Mapping:</h3>

<p>Good: Apple.com there is a good layout on this site.  I feel like I can click on anything on the site and get information.  The map layout has a good flow to it and I feel like I am also going somewhere I need to go..

<p>Bad: Jets pizza has horrible mapping.  I think there is only one button that works.  There is no range of controls it seems like.  Nothing really works beside the order now button.</p>

<h4>Chunking:</h4>

<p>Good: Yahoo.com has very good chunking on the website.  You can get the information from different topics of what is going on that day or during the week.  The information for the most important and the layout is simple.</p>

<p>Bad:  Facbook.com goes up and down when it comes to chunking.  Some information isnâ€™t important and shouldnt be on the site.  There is so much information on the site that sometimes your brain cant handle it.</p> 

<h5>Ockhams Razor:</h5>

<p>Good: Yahoo.com is a very simple design.  Everything is very simple and is easy to navigate.  You can find everything you need on the home page.</p> 

<p>Bad: Jets.com this site looks like a simple design but nothing works.  There is only one button that really works (the order button).  The site looks simple but gets very frustrating when you want to order a pizza.  It has the look but not the usability.</p>
