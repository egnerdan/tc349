                <h3>The Awesome Stuff I Have Done This Month</h3>
                <ul>
                    <p>Just finished my first Marathon at the age of 22.  Ran the first 18-miles at 6:40 pace and was right on pace for breaking three hours.  Then before I knew it I had leg cramps in both legs.  From mile 18 to mile 26.2 I had to walk hobble jog all the way to the finish.  Those last 8 miles was probably one of the most difficult things that I have ever had to do mentally.  Having to go #2 in the middle of the race would have been better then having leg craps in both legs.  Once you get leg cramps in a race there is no way of getting rid of them, unless you stop for a few hours and stretch. Good news is I finished my first marathon and got run all around Chicago.  I finished the Marathon in 3 hours and 24 minutes, not bad for having leg cramps for 8 mile. </p>
